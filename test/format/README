Tracing format operations can be useful in debugging.

Turn on tracing with the "-t" flag:

    -t	Trace operations into a WiredTiger log

That causes format to trace operations in a WiredTiger log.

By default only modifications and transactions are traced to limit how much data is stored.
You can trace more operations by adding "trace.XXX" configurations to the run:

    trace.bulk=1	trace bulk loads
    trace.cursor=1	trace cursor operations
    trace.read=1	trace read operations
    trace.timestamp=1	trace timestamp operations (setting oldest, stable TS)

By default, operations are logged into a separate database from the run, "OPS.TRACE" in the
run's home directory. If you want to trace format operations with logs from in the WiredTiger
library, you can log format operations into the primary database:

    trace.local=1	trace into the primary database

By default, only 10 log files are retained at a time, but you can increase that number if you
need longer tracking:

    trace.log_retain=100

After the run, you can dump the trace records with the wt utility:

    wt -h RUNDIR/OPS.TRACE printlog -um

The output will look something like this:

The fields are a timestamp, a thread and session ID, and then an operation. When the operation
is per object (like and update or remove), there's an object name and a row number.


Additionally, when format detects a failure, it will dump the cursor page that was the source
of the row that didn't match the expected value, as well as the history store. The dumps are
in format's run directory, in files named "FAIL.pagedump" and "FAIL.HSdump".
