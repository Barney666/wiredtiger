# Helper scripts and data for WiredTiger pull requests

**sme_groups.json**

SME (Subject Matter Expert) groups track which developers have knowledge, or would like to build up knowledge, on a component. The file contains a mapping from a list of WiredTiger components - these matche the list of components available on WT Jira tickets - and a list of github usernames of developers in that SME group.  
Note that developers in this list are only assigned to a PR, which is distinct from the list of PR reviewers. These developers are not expected to handle every single PR for the component, just to be aware of any ongoing work.
